<p><font face="verdana" color="white">My life as an artist began in early 2017. During this time, I’d usually come back from school with doodles or ideas that I had but wasn’t sure on how to create. I was taking coding classes back in high school and always thought about how I’d be able to use this skill with my artistic side. I would wander around YouTube looking at amazing projects in game engines like Unity wondering how I could finally begin my journey. At last, after countless hours of looking at videos about starting game development, I had seen how my ideas could turn into real life and not just some writing on a piece of paper. Throughout my life, I’ve been passionate about video games, whether it be the animation, characters, or settings. Being able to create projects that can relate to my love for video games is very important for me. Programs such as Unity helped me explore endless possibilities in expressing my artistic side mixed with technical aspects such as programming.</p></br>

<p>My work varies from multiple mediums. I’ve done projects in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Unity Engine, and programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and HTML. However, my main focus lately has turned into game engines such as Unity. The vast range of tools in the engine has helped me connect to my personal passion for video games. In one of my works titled “Sci-Fi Factory”, I created a 3D scene of a factory that will hopefully be a part of a larger project in the future. It was created using Unity and has various components, ranging from objects such as tubes and barrels to directional lighting inside and out of the building. Aside from the scene, I also created a mobile-influenced game titled “Cube Slider” using Unity and C#. Being able to implement programming into my game was a great experience since I’ve dealt with a couple of languages such as Python and HTML/CSS. C# has been a great tool and mixed with HTML and CSS as front-end UI, it can possess a strong element for my games.</p></br>

<p>As for the near future, I plan on working on more professional game engines such as Unreal Engine. Being able to create games and scenes using industry-level engines is one of my goals for this year. Unity has taught me a lot and has given me invaluable skills, whether it be in the programming or game development sectors. Being able to implement code into my artwork has helped me express myself with two very different genres. My style is split in half, with art being half and programming being the rest. I’ve only taken ART 74 &75 so far so I’m excited to see what skills I’ll be learning soon.</p>
