This video was focused on exploring the hills in Oakland and getting a view that I've never seen before. I was able to create this video using my DJI drone and then transferring the video file onto my computer. The effects were all done in Premiere Pro along with the background music. It was fun being able to go back to nostalgic places that I've been to countless times during my childhood.</font></h2>
