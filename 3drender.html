<h2><font face="verdana" color="white">For this project, I wanted to get used to 3D rendering software. I was able to create this piece using Blender. This was my first real 3D render that took me a while to create since the little details on the buildings were very time-consuming. My goal was to create a small-scaled city with different building sizes. I tried doing the city of Oakland but it was a bit tougher than I expected so this is a general city layout. The second image is the 3D print that I printed out. The dimensions are 8.4 x 7 inches. Overall, it was very fun and a big learning experience being able to use Blender.</h2><br>
