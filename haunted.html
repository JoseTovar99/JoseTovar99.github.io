<h2><font color="white">I basically did my work on a halloween theme. The work has a tone of blood in the objects, a tree to give a representation of woods, a floating ghost, and fingers to represent creatures underground. The underground fingers are supposed to be trapping the car. When you go into VR mode, you'll be inside the car surrounded by the fingers and the ghost, giving you a more immersive experience. Overall, meant for being creepy. This was created with 3D objects made in Blender.</h2>
