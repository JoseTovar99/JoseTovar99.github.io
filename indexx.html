    <h3><font face="verdana" color="black">The full game is too large and kept crashing my PC when exporting so this is only the first section. The game was created using Unity with C#. Some of the cool effects of the game are the hit detection, the fast-paced movement, and the difficult levels. It was meant to represent "The Worlds Hardest Game" where the levels are very diffcult, making you rage over time. Also, after exporting, the lighting after you beat the first level gets messed up for some reason everytime it gets exported. Use A for left and D for right</h3>
